    "It is lightweight, client-server architecture that uses HTTP (Hyptertext Transfer Protocol) to exchage data between clients and servers. REST is based on the concept of resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform REsource Identifiers), and clients interact with these resources by sending HTTP requests to their URIs. REST also used standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to perform operations on these resources. The data exchange format used in REST is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language), but it can support other format as well.\n",

SOAP also defines a set of rules for message exchnage, such as using XML namespces, and it supports varous security and transactional fetaures.\n",
